@zebrapaperclip That's really rad. Maybe you should actually do that at some point.
Well. Seems someone posted my CodeIgniter/EllisLab thing to Hacker News. 3000+ views in a day. http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1851161
I just unlocked the "Halloween 2010" badge on @foursquare! http://4sq.com/cC0jj3
I finally put my thoughts together on the whole @EllisLab #codeigniter stuff. http://zck.in/2r
@r38y Yeah. We can totally do that, but we're just starting from scratch. Too much of it is old php4 nasty.
@r38y Yeah, you're right.. Maybe I'll just be a Rails guy and work with you guys.
@r38y I'm assuming besides me? See @kylebragger for a reference :)
My brief thoughts on the CodeIgniter thing: http://bit.ly/c4tfKq (via @kylebragger)
Looks like I'm now the proud owner of @dearie6 and @twessage.
@elliothaughin Oh, I get it, you're @myerman.
@natevw Maybe I should leak you outta memory.. Then what?
@mdhopkins Nice.
@reedsandstrings yes!!! Best game ever.
@garyvee How about a product that helps you to focus on 1 project you want to get done for the day..?
@zebrapaperclip Kindof a far drive. I think I'll just to go Carlyle instead.
Rockford Dev types, don't forget I'm going a PHP/CodeIgniter meetup on Tuesday. Giving a short into on CodeIgniter talk.  http://zck.in/2q
@zebrapaperclip I haven't been there since Monday!
@zebrapaperclip Don't worry. That has been resolved.  http://yfrog.com/mtgxzwj
@OmarJasso Tuesday 6pm. Rawkspace. text/email me for more deets.
@jeremya @myerman :(
@dreadfullyposh @philsturgeon we were only so angry because of the childish responses from EllisLab. The framework hasn't changed :)
@jtkendall Use rvm. It will setup up perfect switchable environments for rails 3
@jtkendall I guess you didn't say anything about rails.

@yanathin So. Stoked for your party. That is all.
I -will- be the last person with #NewTwitter
@adam_griffiths One of my accounts has it, that I don't really use, and I feel like it's completely rad. Would replace my desktop client.
@BelRockCityGirl I will, obviously, be at @workrawkspace.

@ilude_iono No #NewTwitter for me still.. They should roll these things out in order of joining.
Has anyone used Rumbletron's Flare ORM?
@dreadfullyposh Well, I wanna play with it but there is zero docs.. Which is fine I suppose. cc: @jamierumbelow
@jamierumbelow I know, the code looks good. I definitely wanna have a play with it.
@jpadilla_ I have a very love/hate relationship with Doctrine. It's extremely powerful, but has HUGE overhead, and has a bit of a learning
@jpadilla_ curve. I know that @dhorrigan was recommending DMZ a while back, but I never had a chance to play with it. Rumble's MY_Model is
@ZackKitzmiller  Not a ORM, but a very handy base model to avoid duplicating CRUD patterns all the time.
@jpadilla_ Hit me on iChat/AIM? zackisamazing
@jpadilla_ It's not -that- horrible. But if you're using it inefficiently, it's bad news.
@jpadilla_ thats fine. Gimme an hour or so.

Hey, #codeigniter peeps. @CloudIgniter is going to give out one beta invitation tonight. Message me to get the one.
@WezPyke Yeah. 14.50 for 3 hosted domains, 28.50 for unlimited-ish hosted domains.
@WezPyke You have thoughts on pricing, we're open to suggestions.
@WezPyke at this point bw is "fair use." 1db per domain, 300mb/domain. But well have a better idea of how that goes after beta.
@pablokorona you sure?
@pablokorona I'm not sure if you've been reading this. http://blog.iphone-dev.org/ but it's the only place you need to go.

@WadeJCampbell That's the hardest wait ever.
@benjiclayton @zigphroid yup.
@philsturgeon I'm gonna say A and B.
I'm hearing noises I've never heard before which can only mean the govt has finally implanted something in my head to monitor my thoughts.
@stevewithington jealous.
@jwage Only three days late on that one Jon...

The whole iPhone/Gizmodo thing is really fun. At least we know it's not a knockoff.
@pablokorona right. Not necessary.
Anyone know of a cheap tow in #rawkford, or happen to have a tow truck? No rush.
@sarandipity How was caribu?
RT @cloudigniter: Todo list is getting shorter before beta launch, but todo items are getting more complex. #codeigniter http://zck.in/27
@philsturgeon Yeah, installing gems has been confusing for me too. Some times it works, some times it doesn't.
@WeberJon I'd assume it's an ad-network, rather than a JS update.
@MPHVAC I wanna play softball. Thank for the invite....
Listened to Snoog Dogg and Dr. Dre all day. No particular reason.

@jangofettish So what exactly does the ticket PRICE cover then, NOT the facility?!!??
@jangofettish Then make tickets $3 more expensive to cover the 'facility' was well. Me, the consumer, doesn't care about their accounting.
@jangofettish And I understand that, and Styx get's a PERCENTAGE of the tix $. The rest should cover everything it needs to cover.
@jangofettish I worked at a venue for a LONG time. Tickets were $10 (or whatev), and we got 25%, that covered 'facilities.'
@jangofettish Still. You think 6 SEPARATE fee's is appropriate?! http://emberapp.com/zackkitzmiller/images/firefox-8
@jangofettish And what the hell is an order charge? If it was $1 per ticket for something.. Fine.. but $13 on a $30 order? Thats 43% OF FEES

@adam_griffiths Python is one of the weirdest languages I ever studied. I just dove straight in with Django, which was even more odd.
@juokaz Can you field another noobie question for me, regarding migrations?
@juokaz I have a horribly ugly existing schema I'm fixing. Can I 'createModelsFromDb' then use migrations to move that data to new tables?
@juokaz Gotcha, I'll just keep banging along here and see what I can come up with.
"@juokaz I'm going to do that. I need to get the new scheme all defined and figured out first.
