It's not exactly a Vapro issue, but it's caused plenty if problems!@centerdrive yep. If you installed zsh, it tends to reset PATH and Wipe out /usr/sbin, which is where those live@snipeyhead go back a few years to their Make Yourself and SCIENCE albums.@centerdrive I know that pain! Lmk if you run into any issues!@centerdrive to avoid having to edit your hosts file.@centerdrive yep! Altho for apache/ nginx the virtual hosts are set to http://t.co/uxNy84hFZC out of the box.

Something to think on...@geochatz oh you'll need hhvm-fastcgi also. Start Vapro with just the "base" script and then do hhvm-fastcgi and nginx@geochatz it's ~75% of the way there on @Vaprobash. You can install HHVM now, and then just need to configure it a bit to run with nginx.Tip from @spamoom on Vagrant Cachier. Looks really interesting to save time on Vagrant-up'ing http://t.co/eIJsTGhvWgRT @spamoom: @fideloper not sure if youâ€™ve seen this, but itâ€™d be perfect to recommend with @vaprobash http://t.co/mBwVDbOX9U@spamoom @vaprobash whoa, thanks. that looks excellent."RT @ianlandsman: Blogged: How To Prune Your Twitter Account
